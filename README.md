# Bachelor-Project
This project focused on developing a motion-controlled game for the Game Boy Pocket, integrating modern sensor technology with classic gaming hardware. The game, a first-person flying simulator, uses an accelerometer to detect motion, allowing players to control an aircraft by tilting the device. The accelerometer data is transmitted via SPI through a custom-made link cable, ensuring real-time movement.

Key Components
Game Development: Designed and programmed using GBDK-2020.
Sensor Integration: Implemented accelerometer data transmission via SPI.
Bluetooth Connectivity: Established connections using an nRF5340 module for multiplayer functionality, enabling competitive and cooperative gameplay.
Hardware Design: Created a prototype PCB to facilitate the integration process.
Challenges and Solutions
Hardware and Software Integration: Optimized performance within the constraints of the Game Boy Pocketâ€™s limited memory and processing power.
Development Documentation: Thoroughly documented the development process from initial design to final implementation, detailing the methods used to overcome various challenges.
This project showcases the blend of retro gaming with modern technology, providing an innovative gaming experience on classic hardware.
